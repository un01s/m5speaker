# m5core2 speaker

This code is from M5Unified/examples/Advanced/Bluetooth_with_ESP32A2DP. Build this with Platform.io. 

Everything is OK. Just the volume of the M5Core2 seems pretty soft. How to increase the default volume of BT?

The volume can be controlled by three buttons of M5Core2. Holding button A and click button B.
